# easy-therapy

This GitHub repository is a design project of KAIST CS374 students (Team Heat) : Spring 2020


The web-site consists of **four** main web-pages (Home, Register, Share, Appointments) and some additional/supplementary pages 
Web pages are named accordingly and their CSS and JavaScript documents are named identically.

All web pages except *Share* use Firebase Firestore API to simulate some of 
the functionality (e.g. registering for and managing appointments)

**Bootstrap** and **WebKit** were used for styling and CSS

**JQuery** was used for easier and more high-level front-end programming

**Google Maps Embed API** was used for the *Home* page
